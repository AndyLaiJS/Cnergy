CSCI3100 Software Engineering 

A group project that revolves around creating a centralised Club Web Application for CUHK, where students can easily discover and join
their desired club. 

The application is built using VueJS. 

NodeJS and npm are assumed to be already installed on your system

### Installing VueJS
```
npm install -g vue
```

### Installing the Vue CLI (needs this too)
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

### To check if installation was successful
```
vue --version
```

Once VueJS is installed and the repository is cloned onto your system, open up a Terminal and navigate towards the directory
holding the repository and type the following command:

```
cd client
npm run serve
```
